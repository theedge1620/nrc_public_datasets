# nrc_public_datasets

This repository houses my project for the General Assembly data science course.  The project proposal is contained in a Jupyter notebook.

Some datasets are downloaded directly from https://www.nrc.gov, and some had to be manually scraped from the public website.

Scraped data and scraping code provided. For example, getINtables3.py scrapes the Information Notices from the NRC's public website, and getRIStables3.py scrapes the Regulatory Issue Summaries from the NRC's public website.
