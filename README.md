# nrc_public_datasets

This repository houses my project for the General Assembly data science course.  The project proposal is contained in a Jupyter notebook.

Some datasets are downloaded directly from https://www.nrc.gov, and some had to be manually scraped from the public website.

Scraped data and scraping code provided.
